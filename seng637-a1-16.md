# Introduction

Prior to this laboratory session, our understanding of testing was quite limited. Our only previous experience was a
single instance in a past course where we tested a Java program. We knew that exploratory testing involved a spontaneous
examination of the product to identify bugs, and that creatively imagining various scenarios was crucial in this type of
testing. As for manual scripted testing, its name suggested that it involved strictly following a predetermined script
to find bugs, with the tests being defined before the testing phase began. This lab session expanded our knowledge of
these testing techniques. Exploratory testing is characterized as a blend of learning, designing tests, and executing
them all at once. It's focused on discovery and depends on the tester's intuition to find defects that might not be
addressed by other testing methods. Conversely, manual scripted testing is largely about creating and executing a test
script, a process somewhat akin to unit testing. We also revisited all the previously identified bugs during regression
testing and reported them. This stage involved updating the status of bugs identified through the first two testing
methods, marking them as either resolved or ongoing.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Exploratory testing involved the creative and spontaneous development of test cases during execution. Our initial focus
was on examining the balance inquiry and withdrawal features. We tested a variety of cases using the money market and
other types of accounts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the software's functionality. Our approach was guided
primarily by our creativity, leveraging our imagination to identify potential scenarios that might contain bugs. Our
chosen and executed procedure for a specific function was as follows:

1. Log in using Card number: 2 and Pin: 1234.
2. Select Balance Inquiry and conduct various spontaneous tests to uncover bugs.
3. Test every visible button on the screen for potential issues.

We applied this methodology not only to the Withdrawal function but also to other features in order to detect bugs.
After completing the testing and bug reporting process using Card number 2, we replicated this testing sequence with
Card number 1 to confirm that all functionalities were error-free.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory testing tends to be more intuitive and is commonly employed during the initial stages of coding. In
contrast, manual testing is a more comprehensive approach, typically conducted after exploratory testing to ensure
thorough bug detection. Manual scripted testing is particularly effective in identifying subtle bugs that might be
overlooked in exploratory testing, thus enhancing bug tracking efficiency. While exploratory testing is faster due to
its unstructured nature, it often leads to the redundant discovery of the same bugs. Therefore, in terms of efficiency,
manual scripted testing is generally more advantageous. However, exploratory testing poses challenges in documentation
and recording compared to manual testing. Although each method has its merits, manual testing is often preferred for its
reliability. It optimizes the time spent on actual coding, despite requiring initial setup time. On the other hand,
exploratory testing has the unique advantage of uncovering unexpected, hidden bugs that might be missed in manual
scripted test cases.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

In our laboratory work, we adhered to the recommended approach of pair testing as outlined in the lab manual. This
method involved having at least two individuals review each identified bug. Such peer review proved beneficial in
eliminating numerous false-positive bugs. Additionally, when one team member reviewed another's findings in our internal
document, they provided valuable feedback for consistency. We also followed the prescribed procedure for documenting and
reproducing bugs, particularly with version 1.1 of our software.

Whenever a bug report was drafted, it was standard practice for our teammate to re-examine the report's format. This
scrutiny ensured that the reports were comprehensive, providing sufficient information to accurately identify the cause
of the defect and its occurrence. We made a concerted effort to conform to the lab manual's recommended structure for
bug reports. Each report detailed the specific function under test, the initial state of the program, the steps required
to replicate the bug, and both the expected and actual outcomes of the test.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

In our pair testing approach, one partner would share their screen and execute either scripted or exploratory test
cases, while the other monitored the test case execution. Following each test's execution, one of the partners was
responsible for logging any discovered bugs in the system. We alternated roles for each test case, ensuring that both
partners gained practical experience in testing.

One key advantage of this collaborative approach in both exploratory and manual testing was the opportunity to discuss
and deliberate over potential bugs, thereby reducing the likelihood of errors. Collaborating with a partner also offered
fresh perspectives on the testing process and fostered the generation of diverse ideas.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The absence of a specified structure or predefined steps in exploratory testing presented challenges in conceiving test
cases, as well as in reporting and tracking bugs. The indeterminate number of test cases further complicated the
exploratory testing process. To address these issues, we adopted a strategy of reporting bugs as soon as they were
discovered, bypassing attempts to reproduce them, in line with the inherent nature of exploratory testing.

Through this experience, we realized that manual testing offers a more structured approach, enabling more efficient and
systematic execution of tests. Furthermore, we learned that manual scripted testing facilitates easy replication of
tests due to the pre-documentation of the script, enhancing the overall testing process.
